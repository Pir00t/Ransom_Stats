# About

This project is aimed at providing statistical analysis of ransomware leaks, where a _tree_ file has been provided by the group behind the attack.

From a review of ransomware chats and screenshots from projects such as [ransomch.at](https://ransomch.at) and [ransomlook](https://www.ransomlook.io), the threat groups like to utilise a tree structure when providing evidence of data exfiltration. Unfortunately, they do not always conform to a set _tree_ standard output Therefore, I will update this repo as and when I establish proper parsing for a group.
